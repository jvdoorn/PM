# PM assignments (2019)

This repository contains my implementations for the PM assignments. The assignments have been created by Dr. Walter Kosters and have been implemented by me (Julian van Doorn) as part of the class "Programmeer Methoden". Each separate assignment contains the description of the assignment.
 
Note that these implementations are not perfect and have merely been published for reference.
